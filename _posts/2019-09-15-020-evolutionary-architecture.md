title: "Evolutionary Architecture"
intro: "The way how software architecture works has changed tremendously, especially with iterative approaches that foster fast changes and delivery like scrum or kanban. Evolutionary architecture is a set of concepts and patterns to design system in a way to expect change. Patrick gave us a deep, but very practical insight into the ideas and techniques behind this new architectural approach."
