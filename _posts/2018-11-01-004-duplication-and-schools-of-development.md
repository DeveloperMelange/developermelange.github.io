title: "Duplication, Duplication, and dependencies - mixed with schools of development"
date: 2018-11-01 07:00:00 +0100
intro: "How bad is duplication on different levels? When should we prefer having some code in our codebase over taking the dependency to a library? Is all duplication equal? In the first topic of this episode we discuss several aspects of duplication in a code base and the impact on stability, maintainability and reliability. For the second topic we discuss some schools of software development, from eXtreme Programming to Programming M.F.. Do they support different personalities of team members? Or should we try to consolidate on a single school within a team? For the last topic we don't feel to have a proper conclusion. So - what are your experiences on schools of software development. Interesting discussions guaranteed!"
