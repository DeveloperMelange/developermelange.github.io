intro: "We talked with Patrick about his understanding of what makes a good lead. He gave us a deep inside into the skills you probably need to learn, to bring yourself into this position and a hand of very useful tips to start this journey. All this, mixed with couple of very interesting insights about the inner-workings of N26."
