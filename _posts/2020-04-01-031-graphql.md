intro: "In this episode, we discussed with Nik Graf about GraphQL and why he thinks it is a future-proof way to create APIs for client applications. We tried to distill the main advantages over classical REST, and figured out scenarios when it shines, but also took a look at possible drawbacks. TL/DR: Everything you need to know if you are interested to get started with GraphQL."
