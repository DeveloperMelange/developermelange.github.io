intro: 'We talked with Sebastian Daschner, a Java Champion about the future of Java Enterprise, the new Eclipse Microprofile and what’s behind Quarkus. As not of all us are Java-Heads this episodes also contains a few “Explain it to me like I’m 6” segments which bring light into a few core concepts of the Java ecosystem and its history. Last but not least, why is there no Java Conference in Vienna?'
